#With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

#Example
#Print i as long as i is less than 6:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

  #With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

#Example
#Exit the loop when i is 3:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

  #With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

#Example
#Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

  #Example
#Print a message once the condition is false:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
