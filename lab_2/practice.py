"""
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

If statement:
"""
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

  #The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

#Example
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

  a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

  #Example
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")

  if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

  a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

#Example
#One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

#The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:

#Example
#Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")

  #Example
#Test if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c:

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")

  #Example
#Test if a is NOT greater than b:

a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:
  print("a is NOT greater than b")

  #Example
x = 41

if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")

    #if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

#Example
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
