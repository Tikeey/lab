Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
"""
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

#Multiline Comments
#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#Example
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

"""
